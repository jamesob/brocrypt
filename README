Brocrypt is a procedure for pretty easily storing secrets with people
who are comfortable with basic commandline usage.

It uses Python and cryptography's <https://cryptography.io/en/latest/> Fernet
interface (AES-128).


# Install

$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamesob/brocrypt/master/install | bash
$ brocrypt --help


# Sample usage

    $ echo "my message" | brocrypt enc


    Make this encrypted message accessible in some hosted service (email, Dropbox,
    1password, etc.) identified by the key id "040451abacfbdda10bd3f3df5abb303047bd7b59" (e.g. use this as an email
    subject line). If you're sharing this with someone else, email it or
    send it to them.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Then, share these decryption instructions in another hosted service:

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    You've been given an encrypted message.

    To unencrypt the message, place the message payload identified by
    "040451abacfbdda10bd3f3df5abb303047bd7b59" (check your email) into a file called "infile".

    Then run

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamesob/brocrypt/master/install | bash
    ./brocrypt dec 4evTvIZPkRjUjIiuhpBUI4PP6wLs4rTzYwcFA3M4os8= infile

    !!! Remember to delete any files containing this information.
